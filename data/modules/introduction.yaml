        Passwords are the most common form of authentication, but weak passwords can be easily cracked. 
        To create a strong password, it is important to use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        Avoid using personal information or common words.

        To create a strong password, it is important to use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
        For example, instead of using "password123" use "P@ssw0rd123!". Also, avoid using personal information or common words.
    - title: Password Managers
      ordinal: 3
      content: >-
        A password manager is a software that stores and encrypts your passwords, allowing you to create unique and complex passwords for each of your online accounts without the need to remember them. 
        They also alert you when a website you use has been hacked.
    - title: Two-Factor Authentication
      ordinal: 4
      content: >-
        Two-Factor Authentication is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password, but also something that only the user has, such as a mobile device. 
        This can be a text message or a call to a phone number, or an app that generates a code.
        It makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to your account because they would need to have possession of your mobile device.
    - title: Phishing Awareness
      ordinal: 5
      content: >-
        Phishing is a technique used by cybercriminals to trick you into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information.
        It's important to be aware of the methods used in phishing attempts, such as emails or messages that ask you to click on a link or provide personal information.
        Always be suspicious of unsolicited messages and never click on links or enter personal information unless you are certain that the request is legitimate.
    - title: Public WiFi Security
      ordinal: 6
      content: >-
        Public WiFi networks can be convenient, but they are also a security risk.
        When connected to a public WiFi network, your device is vulnerable to hacking, phishing and other cyber attacks.
        To protect yourself when using public WiFi, avoid using it for sensitive transactions, such as online banking or shopping.
        Use a VPN to encrypt your connection and use your mobile network instead if possible.
    - title: Keeping your Software Up-to-date
      ordinal: 7
      content: >-
        Software vendors release updates and patches to fix known security vulnerabilities.
        By keeping your software up-to-date, you can protect your device from these vulnerabilities and potential attacks.
        Make sure to regularly check for updates for your operating system, web browsers, and other software you use.
        Enable automatic updates if possible.

        ordinal: 1
        content: >-
          Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation and 
          deception to trick people into giving up sensitive information or 
          performing actions that could lead to a security breach. Common 
          techniques include phishing, baiting, and pretexting.
      - title: Phishing Scams
        ordinal: 2
        content: >-
          Phishing is a type of social engineering attack in which an 
          attacker attempts to trick a user into providing sensitive information 
          or performing an action by disguising themselves as a trustworthy 
          source. This can include emails, text messages, and phone calls. 
          
          It's important to be suspicious of unsolicited requests for personal 
          information and to verify the identity of the sender before 
          responding.
      - title: Spear Phishing
        ordinal: 3
        content: >-
          Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing that is directed at 
          specific individuals or organizations. It's important to be cautious 
          of requests for personal information or action from unknown 
          individuals, especially if they contain personal information.
